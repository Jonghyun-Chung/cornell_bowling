# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. **The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.**

**You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own.** These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should probably include these elements. Feel free to remove or add other terms, too.**

1. To what goals do we all commit?

Our goal is to make a professional, functional website for our client to the best of our ability. We want to work well with each other and distribute work fairly to ensure that everyone participates sufficiently.

2. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)

- Always check the group chat and respond promptly- as soon as possible.
- All members should show up to the meeting unless they have valid excuses.
- Treat each other with respect and listen actively to other member's ideas.
- Complete assignments on time to the best of your ability.
- Making use of flex deadlines is okay.
- Everyone should be responsible for their assigned work.
- We will make sure to split the work equally and fairly.
- Make sure to collaborate and communicate with team members.

3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

- We will use a group chat as our main method of communication and each member should check it actively every day.
- We will meet at least once a week (usually Thursdays after 5) in person/zoom depending on our availability in order to check in with each other and make sure that everyone is on the right track.

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

- We will primarily use email to contact members of the club e-board.

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**NO "CODER" OR "DESIGNER" ROLES!**)

- Member responsibilities: The minimum level of quality we should strive for is to meet rubric expectations and points, however, all group members should still do their best to achieve the highest level of quality in their work.
- Tasks will be delegated during group discussions, taking into account members' requests.
- All group members will be responsible for at least one page of content, in both HTML and CSS. We will be peer reviewing each other's code. Comments should be added to guide the peer reviewers through the code.

6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

- We will kindly and respectfully message in the group chat if someone is not doing his/her work properly. If they refuse to do their work after we message them more than 3 times, we will notify course staff-- not with the intent of asking them to resolve the issue for us, but to make it easier to hold the group mate accountable.
- We will not do the work for a team member who is not contributing. We will do everything in our power to communicate with and rectify such a situation. If no resolution is met, peer evaluations and repository contributions will serve as a signifier of their lack of contribution to the course staff.

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

- We will dedicate the first 5 minutes of every meeting to allow group members to address any concerns they may have. Even if it is a conflict between two people, it should still be brought up, as it affects the morale of the entire group.
 - If we have a larger disagreement, we can have a meeting where we let each other know how we feel (a forum like setting with a mediator).
 - For code disagreements we can hold a vote and each member can share their opinions to defend their decisions. If the code disagreement relates to the assignment rubric/ specifications, we may consult the course staff.

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

First a member should use the contract to answer any initial questions. For questions not answered in the contract, a member can pose an amendment in the chat, or they can ask to hold a meeting where we all collectively revisit the contract.

9. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)

If we do not feel too exhausted, we will throw a little party after finishing the final milestone.

## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info1300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before the instructor will intervene.
