# Group Project: Design Journey

**You are encouraged to work ahead on everything on this project.** (Though we suggest you hold back on the
interactivity until Project 3.) **Each section is required for a specific milestone. You are required to have these
sections completed before that milestone's deadline.**

**Be clear and concise in your writing.** Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in Markdown Preview.** If it's not visible in Markdown Preview, then we
won't grade it. We won't give you partial credit either. This is your warning.

# Client (Milestone 1)

## Client Questionnaire (Milestone 1)

1. Describe your organization and its purpose.


2. What makes your organization and its activities/events unique?


3. Why are you looking for a new website or updating your existing site?


4. Who do you want to visit your site? Who is your site's target audience?


5. When visiting your site, what things do you want your visitors to be able to do?


6. What are your goals for this site?


7. Is there a "feel" that you want for your site? Are there colors or imagery that you have in mind?

8. What are your three favorite competitors or similar organizations' sites? Why?

9. Are you willing to provide us information including images and written content for the website (e.g. logos, team
   photos, bios, etc.)?

10. How often would you like to be updated on the status of the website?

## Client Description (Milestone 1)

> Tell us about your client. Who is your client?
> Explain why your client meets the client rules in the project requirements.

Our client is the Cornell Bowling Club. They are a club that provides a space for players of all skill levels to bowl.

This client meets our client rules in the project requirements because there is no one in our group that is part of the
club or has a close relation to anyone in the club.

## Client Website (Milestone 1)

> Tell us about the website that your client wants. Tell us the purpose of the website and what it is all about.
> NOTE: **If you are redesigning an existing website, give us the current URL and some screenshots of the current site.** (FireFox makes it easy to take a full screenshot of a page.) Tell us how you plan to update the site in a significant way that meets the project's requirements.

The purpose of the website is to inform current and prospective members about club events and logistics. Also to provide
rules and expectations of the club. The website would serve as a central hub for club information and recruitment.

## Client Website Scope (Milestone 1)

> Your project should be ambitious, but not too large. A good rule-of-thumb is that you should have about 1 content-full page for each team member.
> Explain why the website you will create for your client isn't too small and isn't too big. Explain why you think it's the right size for this project.

The content that is important to the organization is limited to the scope of images and written content (photographs,
links, written text). The amount of content will fill at least 4 pages. It is ambitious because in order to meet the
clients goals, there is a lot of content that needs to be organized onto the website. We believe it will be the right
size because we should have about 1 page worth of content for each group member with a variety of elements.

## Client Goals (Milestone 1)

> What kind of website do they want? What are their goals for the site?
> There is no required number of goals. You need as many goals as necessary to reflect your client's desires.

- Goal A: Provide users with information about the club (meeting times, events, competitions, executive board,
  expectations, merchandise, contact).
- Goal B: Emphasize inclusivity-- the club accepts members of all skill/ experience backgrounds.
- Goal C: Recruit new members.

## First Client Meeting Minutes/Notes (Milestone 1)

> Include your notes/minutes from the client meeting.

1. Describe org and purpose

- Bowling club is a sports club on campus that is open to all skill levels of bowlers
- brand new to competitive bowlers who have been bowling their entire lives
- goal of the club is to provide a place for studnets to learn about the sport of bowling and relax after a long day of
  classes
- meet people have a good time

2. What makes bowling club unique

- under umbrella of a sports club but are not exclusive
- big thing across campus with orgs --> usually exclusive, lot of tryouts, only certain people can make the team, we
  don't turn anyone away
- bowling is a sport that almost anyone can do --> bowling club provides safe place for all studnets to be a part of the
  sports club
- don't have applications, not asking people to interview and have a good time

(Events)

- 3 meetings a week
- league night on tuesdays --> organized competitive league where its handicapped so people of diff skill levels can be
  competitive
- competitive team branch --> operates under umbrella of the club and travels and bowls for the university
  competitively (12-14 people, sending 2 teams to tournaments)
- recreational in general, but do have many competitive bowlers who spend a lot of time practicing and travelling for
  the university

3. Why new website

- don't have a website, use campusgroups for registration and events and stuff for information
- use instagram, what we run with, use group chats and group mes for the club
- no centralized place to put all of the information (could be campus groups but need to go through many "hoops")
  --> helpful for tracking events and attendance
- goal for website: sometimes people aren't entirely sure what the expectations and rules are for the club (people
  wonder if they can even join)
- those things aren't outlined on instag
- if you like bowling and want to come and be part of the community come, this is what we meet and what we wanna do
- "how does it work, can i join, etc"

4. Particular audience in mind for websites

- mostly students, maybe people outside the cornell community but looking to targe Cornell student body
- use website for recruitment purposes and make sure that info is out there for people to access
- undergrad (or grad students)
-

5. What types of things do you want users to be able to do

- want them to be able to access info about how club works
- info about league night
- being able to reach somewhere
- link to social medias
- want them to see photos and see them at the alley, what they're doing when they're competing, photos at
  events/socials/games

6.

- schedule for competitive team (where, when, etc)
- somewhere to have link to merch sales (merch sales every year)
- people seem to like the designs--> can link out to google form that can be used so people can sign up to buy merch

7. Feel for site: colors/imagery

- could ask recruitment team (that does design and insta ads)
- light and fun, colors are tan and red (not super attached)
- stick with red somewhere

8. Favorite competitor and similar organization's sites

- RIT bowling website
- Binghamton bowling website
- bigger university bowling website with more competitive organized bowling club might be nicer (William Patterson
  bowling team, Witchataw state competitive team.

9.

- absolutely have everything, tons of photos, logos,
- does photography for the club as well
- banner stuff (photo of the alley/lane/ball rack or smth)
- can get specific decorative images in design
- information
- draft up schedule, about us
- general info and schedule and practices and league info should all be in different places

# Site Design/Plan (Milestone 2)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples,
and cases from outside of class.**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be
solid draft quality but doesn't have to be fancy.

## Understanding Users (Milestone 2)

### Audience (Milestone 2)

> Briefly explain your site's audience. Be specific and justify why this audience is a cohesive group with regard to your client's site. This audience should not be overly broad nor arbitrarily specific. It should be a cohesive group with similar _goals_.

Cornell students interested in bowling (encompasses current Bowling Club members).

The Cornell Bowling Club strives to be inclusive towards Cornell students interested in bowling at all skill levels. Even if they have never bowled before or have bowled competitively, the Cornell Bowling Club has a space for them. The website should thus reflect this and provide  insight for students who range from "inexperienced but interested" to "experienced and invested" in their skillsets. Thus, this is an appropriate audience for our website.

### User Interview Questions (Milestone 2)

> Plan the user interview which you'll use to identify the goals of your site's audience.

**User Interview Briefing & Consent:** Hi, I am a student at Cornell University. I'm currently taking a class on web
design and for a project I am (re-)designing a web site for the Cornell Bowling Club. I'm trying to learn more about the
people that might use this site. May I ask you a few questions? It will take about 10-15 minutes. You are free to quit
at any time.

** Questions can be changed to be specific to current Bowling Club members

### Goals (Milestone 2)

> Analyze your audience's goals from your notes above. List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need enough to do the job (Hint: It's more than 1 and probably more than 2).

Goal 1: Being informed about club scheduling logistics (events, meetings)

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
    - Have visible meeting schedule (w/ descriptions)
    - Have visible event schedule (w/ descriptions)
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
    - Many interviewees emphasized the importance of knowing the club's schedule in order to participate as a full
      member and part of the community. Having this information visible on the website is important for current and
      potential members, as well as club functioning.

Goal 2: Being informed about club culture/ community/ expectations

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
    - Have visible information about club leadership (w/ images)
- Have images of club events/ members
- Have information about club expectations/ commitment
- Have a visible mission statement
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
    - Many interviewees emphasized wanting to know more about the organization's leaders and expectations for members.
      Having this information visible on the website is important for current and potential members to feel involved and
      informed.

Goal 3: Knowing how to contact the organization

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
    - Have visible contact information
    - Have visible social media information
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
    - Many interviewees emphasized the importance of being able to access contact information for the club-- whether it
      be to reach out with questions, or social media information for independent research about club logistics or
      events. Having this information visible on the website is important for current and potential members to feel
      involved and informed.

## Content Planning (Milestone 2)

**Plan your site's content.**

### Your Site's Planned Content (Milestone 2)

> List the content you plan to include your personal website. This should be a comprehensive list.

- bowling team images
- about information
- meeting location
- meeting times
- eboard information
- eboard contact
- competitive team information
- merchandise Information
- social media information
- specific fee information
- rules
- upcoming events
- join groupme/ listserv
- perks
- more information about competitive team (how to join, etc)

### Content Justification (Milestone 2)

> Explain (about a paragraph) why this content is the right content for your site's audience and how its addressed their goals..

This content is the right content for our site's audience because they address our audience's goals. For instance, the
meeting location, meeting times, and upcoming events are all to meet the first goal of being informed about club
scheduling logistics. Also, information about eboard, the competitive team information, merch, and about the club
overall meet the second goal of wanting to be informed about the club in terms of its culture, community, and
expectations. The perks, rules, and specific fee information also fit into this goal because it is important information
about the club and what can be expected when joining. And the content for eboard contact, social media, and joining the
listserv/Groupme meets the third goal of how to contact the club.

## Information Architecture (Milestone 2)

### Content Organization (Milestone 2)

> Document your iterations of card sorting here.
> Include photographic evidence of each iteration of card sorting and description of your thought process for each iteration.

Iteration 1:

In this first iteration, we first grouped the bowling team images and the about information because these seemed to fit
in well for an 'About' page about the bowling club. We grouped meeting times, meeting locations, and upcoming events
because they are all information related to club meetings/events. We also grouped eboard contact, eboard information,
groupme/listserv, and social media links because these are all content related to contacting the club or getting to know
them. We also grouped competitive team info, more info about competitive team, and competitive team images because they
are all related to the competitive team. And the last group consists of rules, fee info, perks, and merch info because
these all didn't seem to have a place in other groups and we saw them more as information on an FAQ of a website.

![Card Sorting Iteration 1](card-sorting-iteration-1.png)

Iteration 2:

In this second iteration, we grouped bowling team images, about information, meeting times, meeting location, and
upcoming events because these are all related to learning more about the club and meeting logistics. We also had the
same group for eboard contact, eboard information, groupme/listserv, and social media links because these are all
related to contacting or joining the club. We also kept the group for the competitive team as in iteration 1. And our
last group also consists of rules, fee info, perks, and merch info because these all didn't really fit into the other
groups and would make sense in an FAQ section.

![Card Sorting Iteration 2](card-sorting-iteration-2.png)


Iteration 3:

This third iteration was similar to the second, except the groupme/listserv information as well as the social media links were moved onto the homepage. For similar reasons to the second iteration, we have these four pages based on meeting logistics, more specific questions (FAQ), competitive team information, and eboard information (rather than social media/group chat communication in general). This way users can see eboard information separately see immediate contact information with other essential information.


![Card Sorting Iteration 3](card-sorting-iteration-3.png)

### Final Content Organization (Milestone 2)

> Which iteration of card sorting will you use for your website?

Iteration 2

> Explain how the final organization of content is appropriate for your site's audiences and their goals.

This card sort is separated into an About Us section, a Competitive Team section, an FAQ section, and a Connect section.

By pairing logistical information about meeting times and events with the general information about the club, we can
ensure that the information is easy to find for current and potential members-- this addresses the goal of being
informed about club scheduling logistics. It also addresses the user goal of knowing more about the club culture, since
such information would be front and center in this section.

By keeping the competitive team information together in one section, we can ensure that anyone who is interested in
joining the competitive team or learning more about it can find the information quickly.

By condensing leadership and social media/ contact information into the same section, we can reduce the difficulty of
navigating to this information-- for example, if we kept separate "Contact" and "Leadership" groups, it wouldn't be
intuitive that the Leadership information also involves the leaders' contact information. Thus, grouping this
information together is the best way to ensure that the audience can quickly find information that will be useful for
reaching out or joining the club within the same section. This addresses the audience goal of knowing how to contact the
organization.

By keeping smaller parts of information such as fees, merchandise, etc. together, we can ensure that the rest of the
website information that addresses user goals is not cluttered. An FAQ section would allow users to quickly find smaller
bits of information that they missed on other pages, or just would like to know without having to reach out to the
organization. This helps the user goals of being informed, and the content of the information of this page (such as
rules) addresses the user goal of knowing about expectations and culture.

### Navigation (Milestone 2)

> Please list the pages you will include in your personal website navigation.

- About Us
    - bowling Team images
    - about information
    - meeting times
    - meeting location
    - upcoming events

- Competitive Team
    - competitive team info(general info)
    - more info about competitive team(how to join, etc)
    - competitive team images

- Connect
    - eboard contact
    - eboard information
    - groupme/listserv
    - social media links

- FAQ
    - rules
    - fee info
    - perks
    - merch info

> Explain why the names of these pages make sense for your site's audience and their goals.

Since our first page contains information about bowling team in general, including what they do, their upcoming events
and some images of the team. Also, we included meeing times and meeting location in AboutUs tab since they are
information that most of our audiences are looking for. We named the second page as Competitive team since it contains
information about what the competitive team is, some images of it, and how we can join the competitive team. For the
third page, we named it Connect because through this page, audiences can put themselves to their listserv or they can
reach out to eboard members with their contacts in the page. We named the last page as FAQ since it contains information
about things that audiences might be curious of including rules, fee info and merch info.

## Design (Milestone 2)

### Visual Theme (Milestone 2)

> Discuss several (more than two) ideas about styling your site's theme. Explain why the theme ideas are appropriate for your target audiences.
> Note the theme you selected for you site and why it's appropriate for the audience and their goals.

We decided that a visual theme which gives a fun and energetic feeling while staying true to the general color scheme associated with bowling would be most appropriate for our website and its audience. Our audience is Cornell students with an interest in bowling, so by utilizing this type of theme we can engage our audience with the website content and encourage them to participate in bowling at Cornell. In order to do this, color schemes which include colors such as white, black, red, gray, and brown would be most appropriate, and using the sans serif font family would create an air of familiarity and fun for the audience. The following visual theme ideas employ this idea:

- Brown nav bar, light brown background, black body text, sans serif font family, small caps for titles, brown heading text, light brown links
- Brown nav bar, white background, black body text, sans serif font family, small caps for titles, light brown heading text, light brown links
- Brown nav bar, white background, black body text, sans serif font family, small caps for titles, red heading text, red links
- Red nav bar, white background, black body text, sans serif font family, small caps for titles, red heading text, red links
- Black nav bar, white navigation links, sans serif font family, red & blue heading text, blue links
- Light brown/ wood-ish background, white body background, red nav bar, white navigation links, gray sidebar, brown/ red headings
- Light brown/ wood-ish background, off-white body background, red nav bar, white navigation links, gray sidebar, brown/ red headings

The visual theme idea we have chosen is "light brown/ wood-ish background, off-white body background, red nav bar, white navigation links, gray sidebar, brown/ red headings." We have chosen this theme because it employs all of the ideas stated above, while also bringing emphasis to the main content of the website through the use of a border. We contemplated the ways we could retain an air of fun while using all solid colors for our site theme, and decided that using a background image of sorts, especially one which is wood, would allow us to do this without straying from the subject of the site-- bowling. Because our website is meant for Cornell students who are interested in bowling, this visual theme idea is the most appropriate.



### Interactivity Ideas (Milestone 2)

> Brainstorm several ideas for your site's interactivity.
> Provide a very brief summary how each idea improves the usability of the site for the site's audience.

1. Carousel:
- Include a carousel consisting of images of the club team and competitive team, bowling stills, event stills, etc.
- This idea improves usability because it allows the user to look through multiple photos of the club on the same page and put faces/members to the name/information about the club.

2. Gallery (mainly for "mobile" version):
- Include a gallery rather than a carousel; same rational as the carousel above (allows users to look through a variety of images with ease).
- We would mainly implement this gallery for mobile to make it easier to access and use for those on smaller handheld devices.

3. Hamburger Menu (mobile):
- Include a hamburger menu at the top left corner of the mobile site to ensure that the main content takes up the majority of the page and the navigation does not conflict with that on smaller screens. This would improve visibility of the main information (images, text, etc) on smaller screens.

4. Collapsible  
- Include a collapsible tab for the FAQ page for each respective section. When the user clicks the "+", the page drops down and the user can see the questions and answers for that respective category.  
- This would make it easier for users to search for specific information based on the category of question it's in (i.e., for questions about dues/fees, check the dues/fees section without having to scroll through questions they may not need answered.

5. Buttons:
- Include a "JOIN" button that leads to a form that prospective members can fill out in order to sign up for the club (ex: lead to a google form for users to input their information).
- This will be at the top of the page near the navigation so that users can join right away and know where to join without searching through the rest of the pages.


### Layout Exploration (Milestone 2)

> Iterate on your site's design through sketching.
> Sketch both the mobile and desktop versions of the site.
> Here you are just exploring your layout ideas. You don't need to sketch every page.
> Provide an explanation for each sketch explaining the idea and the design patterns you are leveraging.

We iterated on designs for the home page.

**Desktop Home Page Iterations:**

Iteration 1:

For this first iteration, we first designed the navigation bar to be horizontal and the bowling club logo would be aligned to the left and the navigation links would be aligned to the right. Then we have a header with text (Cornell Bowling Club) and with an image as the background. We then have a carousel of images (of members bowling) which would be in a vertical flexbox with the 'About Us' section. The carousel has its arrow buttons outside of the images. We would also have this entire section (carousel and 'About Us') in a horizontal flexbox with the aside. In this aside, we have meeting times, location, and upcoming events information. And lastly, we have a footer which contains social media links for the bowling club, which are aligned to the right.

![Desktop Home Page Sketch 1](layout-exploration-desktop-1.png)

Iteration 2:

In this second iteration, we have the same navigation and footer design as in iteration 1. We just have a header of 'Cornell Bowling Club', without a background image, and then we placed a carousel below it which takes up the whole width of the page. The carousel has its arrow buttons on top of the images. And then below the carousel, we have a horizontal flexbox which contains the 'About' section and the aside (containing the meeting logistics and upcoming events).

![Desktop Home Page Sketch 2](layout-exploration-desktop-2.png)


**Mobile Home Page Iterations:**


Our first mobile design sketch is shown on the left in the figure below. In this sketch, we decided to use a hamburger menu for the navigation. For the rest of the content, we just stacked them vertically. We have a header with the text 'Cornell Bowling Club' and below it we have the carousel for bowling images. Then below this, there are sections for 'Who We Are' and 'Bowl With Us' (meeting logistics), which are in a 'card-style' (solid border) and aligned to the left.


Our second mobile design sketch is shown on the right in the figure below. In this design sketch, we have the same hamburger menu, header and sections ('Who We Are', 'Bowl With Us', and 'Upcoming Events'). We decided to get rid of the carousel and instead have 1 or 2 images below the sections (these images would be from the set of images in the carousel).

![Mobile Home Page Sketches](group-mobile-iteration.jpg)


### Final Interactivity Design (Milestone 2)

> Explain and/or provide annotated sketches of the interactivity you will implement for your site.
> Explain how the interactivity improves the usability of the site and helps the site's audiences meet their goals.

1. Hamburger Menu (mobile)
- For the mobile version, we will have the navigation bar collapsed into a drop-down menu rather than laid out horizontally. The hamburger menu will be placed at the top left of the screen, which is a more familiar position for users with smaller screens. When the user tabs/clicks on the menu, it will expand to show the four pages: About Us, Competitive Team, Connect, and the FAQS, which users can click on from there and navigate to a different page while still on the page they are on. This will help the audience meet their goals because, for those that are on smaller screens, the information will be clearly displayed as soon as they open the site rather than have a navigation bar blocking information about meetings/scheduling, logistics, etc..

2. Carousel (desktop)
- For the desktop version, we will have two carousels that extend across the width of the page and sit at the top of the pages (beneath a brief paragraph for the "Competitive Team" page) . These will contain about 4-5 photos of the bowling club and competitive team in candid photos. When users click the arrows they go through the photos or click the dots to view a specific photo. Users will be able to  This will allow the images to be in their own space for users to look through without it interfering with the text. Also, it will allow users to get a sense of the club's community and culture by seeing how members interact with one another during club activities and events.

3. Button ("join listserv/groupme") [subject to change]
- On our "connect" page, we may have a button that sits at the top of the page in a section labeled "JOIN". Users will click the button and be redirected to a page/form where they can sign up for the listserv or join the Groupme. This will allow users to quickly access direct communication to the club members and eboard and get updates in real time (if they are serious about the club). They will be able to find out another way to contact eboard members and find others who are interested in the club.

4. Collapsible
- In our FAQ section, we will have collapsible tabs for each category of question (fee, rules, etc). When users press the "+", they will see more specific answers to questions within that category. They can collapse or expand the tabs as desired based on the questions they need answered. This will help user be informed about the club's rules and expectations without being overwhelmed by other information. They also will not have to scroll through too much text and should be able to find their answers right away.


### Final Design (Milestone 2)

> Include the final sketches for **each** of your site's pages.
> The sketches must include enough detail that another 1300 student could implement them.
> Provide a explanation for each sketch.

**Mobile Design:**

In all of the mobile designs, the navigation is a hamburger menu. Also, on the top of every page we have the title 'Cornell Bowling'.

'About Us' and 'Competitive Team' Pages:

The final sketches for the 'About Us' and 'Competitive Team' pages are in the figure below.

For the 'About Us' page, we have a header 'Cornell Bowling Club'. Then below we have sections, which are stacked vertically, for 'Who We Are' (information about club), 'Bowl With Us' (meeting logistics), and 'Upcoming Events'. The text in these sections will be left-aligned. Also, there will be 1 image below the 'Bowl With Us' and 'Upcoming Events' section because we chose not to have a carousel as in the desktop final sketch.

For the 'Competitive Team' page, we have a header 'Competitive Team'. Then below we have sections and images stacked vertically. The first section will have information about the competitive team and below it there will be a team image. After this there is a section for more specific information about the competitive team. Below this, there are 2 more images of the competitive team. We don't have a carousel as in the desktop design, so we instead have these images.

![Mobile Final Sketch 1](group-mobile1.jpg)


'Connect' and 'FAQS' Pages:

For the 'Connect' page, we have a header 'Connect'. The sections below will be in a 'card-style' (solid borders). We have the 'Join Listserv/GroupMe' section which has a button which will lead to an external site to join the club. Below this we have the 'General' section which has information on the general contact email and links to social media. Next, we have the section for 'Leadership' which has information on the eboard of the club. There is a 'card' for each eboard member which contains information about them such as name, position, and email. All of these cards are stacked vertically and text is aligned to the left.

For the 'FAQS' page, we have the header 'FAQS'. We have a dropdown for the FAQ sections (Rules, Perks, Fees, and Merch). Each of these sections are stacked vertically with the tex aligned to the left. When a user clicks the '+' button, it toggles that section to collapse/uncollapse.

![Mobile Final Sketch 2](group-mobile2.jpg)


**Desktop Design:**

In all of the desktop designs, the navigation bar is horizontal. On the left we would have the logo for the Cornell Bowling Club and the navigation links would be aligned to the right.

'About Us' and 'Competitive Team' Pages:

The final sketches for the 'About Us' and 'Competitive Team' pages are in the figure below.

For the 'About Us' page, we have a header 'Cornell Bowling Club' and the carousel of bowling team images is below it. We then have 3 sections below the carousel ('Who We Are', 'Bowl With Us', and 'Upcoming Events'). The 'Who We Are' contains info about the club and 'Bowl With Us' has meeting logistics and these 2 sections would be in a horizontal flexbox. The last section, "Upcoming Events", is below these 2 sections. In all of these sections, the text is left-aligned.

For the 'Competitive Team' page, we have a header 'Competitive Team' and some info about the team below it. We also have a carousel of images of the competitive team. Below this carousel we have 2 sections which would be in a horizontal flexbox. The left section would have more information related to the competitive team and on the right would be an image of the team.

![Desktop Final Sketch 1](group-desktop1.jpg)

'Connect' Page:

The final sketch for the 'Connect' page is below.

In this final sketch, we have a header 'Connect'. Below this, we have 2 sections ('Join Listserv/GroupMe' and 'General') which would be in a horizontal flexbox. The 'Join Listserv/GroupMe' section has some info about joining and then a button which will lead to a Google form. The 'General' section contains a general contact email and links to social media. Below these 2 sections is the 'Leadership' section. This section is in a 'grid' format and each box would contain information about an eboard member. So information such as name, position, and email.

![Desktop Final Sketch 2](group-desktop2.jpg)


'FAQS' Page:

The final sketch for the 'FAQS' page is below.

In this final sketch, we have a header 'FAQS'. We designed the FAQS to be dropdown. So initially it would show each section uncollapsed and the user can click the '+' to collapse and show the information related to it. This '+' button acts as a toggle for the user to collapse/uncollapse that section.

![Desktop Final Sketch 3](group-desktop3.jpg)


### Design Rationale (Milestone 2)

> Explain why your design is appropriate for your audience. Specially, why does your content organization, navigation, and site design/layout meet the goals of your users? How did you employ design patterns to improve the familiarity of the site for your audience?

Our design is appropriate for our audience in terms of how it relates to their goals: being informed about club scheduling logistics (events, meetings, being informed about club culture/ community/ expectations, and knowing how to contact the organization. Our audience is Cornell students interested in bowling, including current Bowling Club members. We want to find a way for students interested in bowling at Cornell to easily access the information pertaining to how they can get involved, which sums up the audience goals.

By having information about expectations and culture on the front page (as well as the FAQ section), we can ensure that the audience is able to access this information easily and be informed about it. The same can be said of the scheduling logistics, as they are given their own section on the home page and we may choose to include it on the FAQs as well. In this way we are able to meet the goals of being informed about scheduling logistics and club culture.

In terms of contact information, we have dedicated a page to being able to connect with current members or seek out the organization's other internet profiles. By having this information on its own page, users can find it quickly and with ease. In this way we are able to address the goal of knowing how to contact the organization.

The inclusion of an FAQs page and a page dedicated to the competitive team also allows us to further audience understanding of the club's culture and expectations. Many students may think that the bowling club is exclusively competitive, or exclusively non-competitive. By dedicating a page to providing information about this, the audience can have a better understanding of the club and the commitment expected of them. The FAQs also provides more information about rules, fees, etc. to further this understanding.

We are employing common design patterns in terms of utilizing a vertical scroll for both the desktop and mobile layouts. Furthermore, information that is next to another piece of content is oriented in a left-to-right flow of importance and relevance to the user. Hamburger menus, collapsibles, and carousels are all common interactive features that will allow us to employ familiarity for users. Overall, we designed our layout and visual themes in a way which emphasizes content which is relevant and important to audience goals, makes navigation easy, and does not cause the user confusion in terms of unfamiliarity or impracticality.

## Interactivity Plan (Milestone 2)

> Now that you've designed your interactivity for your site, you need to plan how you will implement it.

    - Mobile
- **How did the user do? Did they meet your expectation?**
    - They completed the task successfully.
- **User’s reaction / feedback to the design** (e.g., specific problems or issues found in the tasks)
    - They did not have much of a reaction because they completed the task very quickly-- "It's right there."
- **Your reflections about the user’s performance to the task**
    - The user completed the task very quickly, likely because the information they were looking for was visible before I read them the task.

- **Re-design choices**
    - Possibly change the name "Expectations" on the FAQ page.
- **Additional Notes**
    - The methodology through which this participant completed the task should be taken with a grain of salt-- they were less focused on completion of the task and more focused on providing "feedback" and familiarizing themselves with the website.

### User 2 - Testing Notes (Final Submission)

> When conducting user testing, you should take notes during the test. Place your notes here.

Task 3: She immediately went to the connect page. she started scrolling to find what she said was the "contact button". Then she clicked on the instagram page saying that it might be there. Immediately after clicking the instagram link, she clicks the back arrow and reads the wording at the top of the page. Then she scrolls down the page, and finds the event coordinator's email.  
Task 1: First she says "I would go to the the FAQ page" and clicks on that page. Then she says she changed her mind and clicks on the about us page. She scrolls down the page and finds the time within seconds.
Task 2: She goes to the FAQ page saying "I think it should be in this page". Then, she says she feels like it would be under expectations, clicks on it, and finds the answer.

### User 2 (Final Submission)

> Using your notes from above, describe your user by answering the questions below.

1. Who is your user, e.g., where does the user come from, what is the user's job, characteristics, etc.?

She is an HBHS/Bio major in her junior year at Cornell. She is a member of the bowling club, and the competitve team.

Yes, she belongs to our audience, she is a member of the bowling club.

### User 2 Results (Final Submission)

> Report the results of your user's evaluation. You should explain **what the user did**, describe the user's **reaction/feedback** to the design, **reflect on the user's performance**, determine what **re-design choices** you will make **for EACH task**. You can also add any additional comments.

Task 3: You have an idea for a club-wide event and want to get in contact with the bowling club's event coordinator. Find the contact information of the events coordinator.

- **Did you evaluate the desktop or mobile design?**
    - Pick one: desktop
- **How did the user do? Did they meet your expectation?**
    - She did not meet my expectations on this task. She thought the information would be on the instagram link. We did not intend the link for this purpose. The information is on the page she clicked on- the connect page- but to find the information requested she had to read the sentence in the subheader, and then find the correct position title. Instead of immediately doing this, she tried finding it on the club's instagram page.
- **User’s reaction / feedback to the design** (e.g., specific problems or issues found in the tasks)
    - She said that it made more sense to her that information about the e board coordinator be housed on the instagram page
- **Your reflections about the user’s performance to the task**
    - I think that the subtitle "leadership" clarifies that information on the Event Coordinator would be housed on the connect page. Eboard member's pictures and title also serve as further indicators.
- **Re-design choices**
    - Based on the previous information, I don't think I would chose to make any redesign choices.

Task 1: You and a friend are interested in going bowling this coming Saturday. Find the time that the bowling club will be meeting on Saturday.

- **Did you evaluate the desktop or mobile design?**
    - Pick one: desktop
- **How did the user do? Did they meet your expectation?**
    - She met my expectations. She finished the task within seconds. However, for a brief second she thought that the time information would be on the FAQ page.
- **User’s reaction / feedback to the design** (e.g., specific problems or issues found in the tasks)
    - She did not have any specific issues with the tasks or design
- **Your reflections about the user’s performance to the task**
    - She did very well, she found the information in about 30 seconds.
- **Re-design choices**
    - Based on how well she did, I don't have any redesign suggestions
- **Additional Notes**
    - n/a


Task 2: You have to miss the next league night because of a scheduling conflict. Find information on how to proceed and what happens if you have to miss a league night.

- **Did you evaluate the desktop or mobile design?**
    - Pick one: desktop
- **How did the user do? Did they meet your expectation?**
    - She went above my expectatins. She performed the best on this task. She immediately went to the FAQ page and selected the correct tab within seconds.
- **User’s reaction / feedback to the design** (e.g., specific problems or issues found in the tasks)
    - She did not have any critiques of the design.
- **Your reflections about the user’s performance to the task**
    - She did very well. I think this demonstrates that the FAQ page is designed intutitively.
- **Re-design choices**
    - I do not have any redesign choices based on her perfomance.
- **Additional Notes**
    - n/a

### User 3 - Testing Notes (Final Submission)

> When conducting user testing, you should take notes during the test. Place your notes here.

Task 2:
- Looks at main page, is searching for information about league night, spends good amount of time on this page
- does not find anything related to league night, hesitates but goes to menu button, thinks for a few seconds then chooses faq
- looks through the faq to find information about league night
- opens all the tabs first, then goes to expectations and finds bolded section on league night (if you miss league night, you can make it up)
- complete.

Task 3:
- goes to menu again, sees connect page, thinks it relates to the eboard
- notices from the pictures and names immediately that it relates to the club eboard
- looks through the site for events coordinator and finds the correct email for the events coordinator using the "profile"
- complete.

Task 1:
- goes back to menu, hesitates for a bit about where times might be, chooses homepage, does not scrolled
- sees meeting time: sat from 1-3

general feedback:
- suggests a general contact page since members might not know exactly who to contact for their question or situation (however, this suggestion would not be possible given that club does not have a general club email and instead uses GroupMe and Listserv)

### User 3 (Final Submission)

> Using your notes from above, describe your user by answering the questions below.

1. Who is your user, e.g., where does the user come from, what is the user's job, characteristics, etc.?

### User 3 Results (Final Submission)

> Report the results of your user's evaluation. You should explain **what the user did**, describe the user's **reaction/feedback** to the design, **reflect on the user's performance**, determine what **re-design choices** you will make **for EACH task**. You can also add any additional comments.

Task: 2:

- **Did you evaluate the desktop or mobile design?**
    - Mobile
- **How did the user do? Did they meet your expectation?**
    - The user exceeded my expectations and was able to find information based on the tasks very quickly. He had little to no issues finding navigating the site and was successful in finding out what to do when missing league night.
- **User’s reaction / feedback to the design** (e.g., specific problems or issues found in the tasks)
    - Looked on the homepage first for information about league night, but we did not have a section on it which prompted him to search the menu. He spent a bit of time on the hamburger menu, looking for another place where information about league might be. Even though the expectations tab was the first tab, Skylar did take some time to look through everything.
- **Your reflections about the user’s performance to the task**
    - For this task, I was surprised that Skylar didn't immediately see the league night information in expectations. He opened other tabs first before expectations which made me think that he assumed it might be under another section. It took him a couple extra seconds to click the buttons mainly because he assumed the entire bar was the button. Will redesign to prevent this.
- **Re-design choices**
    - To avoid confusion and so that users spend less time looking for this information, we can add a separate section on League Night in the FAQ OR on the homepage (preferably on the homepage since it's one of the club's main events, but we also wouldn't want the user to have to scroll down too far). Since on the mobile version the FAQs are going to take up more space, it makes sense that Skylar took longer, but if we changed some of the names of headers it might make certain things easier.
    - I also think we should change the button size/style for the FAQ section on the mobile design. Skylar didn't seem to have a problem finding the buttons, but it did take him a bit longer than I expected (a few more seconds more). Changing the size (i.e., making it bigger and more prominent) and placement of the buttons may make the positioning clearer and make it easier to open and close the panels.

Task 3:

- **Did you evaluate the desktop or mobile design?**
    - Mobile
- **How did the user do? Did they meet your expectation?**
    - The user met my expectation and completed the task successfully.
- **User’s reaction / feedback to the design** (e.g., specific problems or issues found in the tasks)
    - Skylar immediately went to the "connect" page and spent some time scrolling through the board members. However, this was the task that he finished the fastest and didn't seem to have trouble navigating to it. He knew immediately that he would be able to see board members because he saw Jared's photo pop up first (the photos helped him find the events coordinator as well).
- **Your reflections about the user’s performance to the task**
    - I expected Skylar to complete the task quickly since "connect" seems to be the only page that we have that relates to helps users connect with the club specifically. We were initially hesitant about adding headshots to this page to avoid taking up space, but adding the photos seemed to help Skylar recognize where he was and associate emails to the faces.
- **Re-design choices**
    - Due to the speed at which Skylar completed the task, I don't believe ny re-design is needed for this particular page.
- **Additional Notes**
    - n/a

Task 1:
- **Did you evaluate the desktop or mobile design?**
    - Pick one: mobile
- **How did the user do? Did they meet your expectation?**
    - Skylar met my expectations and completed this task successfully.
- **User’s reaction / feedback to the design** (e.g., specific problems or issues found in the tasks)
    - Skylar completed this task at a similar speed as the first two, but there was more hesitation about the placement of the information. He said "maybe" when discussing where he might find the meeting times (even though he had seen them previously). However, despite this slight hesitation, he was able to find the meeting times right away as they were in the center of the page.
- **Your reflections about the user’s performance to the task**
    - I was slightly surprised that he hesitated about where to find the meeting times (this may be due to the fact that the FAQs were viewed before this task). However, he was more confident as soon as he saw the homepage and the box containing the meeting times and days.
- **Re-design choices**
    - Although Skylar took a few more seconds than the other tasks, the fact that he was able to find the information relatively quickly after reaching the homepage tells me that no big design changes are needed.

### User 4 Results (Final Submission)

> Report the results of your user's evaluation. You should explain **what the user did**, describe the user's **reaction/feedback** to the design, **reflect on the user's performance**, determine what **re-design choices** you will make **for EACH task**. You can also add any additional comments.

Task 1: You and a friend are interested in going bowling this coming Saturday. Find the time that the bowling club will be meeting on Saturday.

- **Did you evaluate the desktop or mobile design?**
    - desktop
- **How did the user do? Did they meet your expectation?**
    - He easily found the information he needs to find in the "About Us" tab of the website. He scrolled down to the "Bowl with Us" section and found that the meetings are held between 1:00pm and 3:00pm on Saturdays. Since he could easily find the meeting time on every Saturday, we can say that he met our expectations.
- **User’s reaction / feedback to the design** (e.g., specific problems or issues found in the tasks)
    - He did not find any problem with the website and said that it is neatly organized, and it was easy to find the meeting time.
- **Your reflections about the user’s performance to the task**
    - Since he did a great job in finding information he needs to find, I think contents in "About Us" page are well-organized.
- **Re-design choices**
    - I do not think we need to redesign something in the main page.
- **Additional Notes**
    - Since he could successfully finish the first task, I think it would be okay to keep the main page as it currently is.

Task 2: You have to miss the next league night because of a scheduling conflict. Find information on how to proceed and what happens if you have to miss a league night.

- **Did you evaluate the desktop or mobile design?**
    - desktop
- **How did the user do? Did they meet your expectation?**
    - After listening to the task, he directly clicked FaQ tab and clicked "+" button next to Expectations tab. Then after reading through questions inside the Expectations tab, he found what to do when he misses a league night. Although it was a task that involves multiple steps, he easily found the information that he needed to find.
- **User’s reaction / feedback to the design** (e.g., specific problems or issues found in the tasks)
    - He said that it was pretty straightforward and easy to find the answer to the question "What should I do if I miss a league night?" in the FaQ tab and the UI was user-friendly.
- **Your reflections about the user’s performance to the task**
    - I expected that it would take little longer than the amount of time he spent on this task, but since he could find the information he needed to find more quickly, I think the content organization of the FaQ tabs page is okay.
    - After listening to the task, he directly clicked FaQ tab and clicked "+" button next to Expectations tab. Then after reading through questions inside the "Expectations" tab, he found what to do when he misses a league night.

    - He said that it was pretty straightforward and easy to find the answer to the question "What should I do if I miss a league night?" in the FaQ tab and the UI was user-friendly.
- **Your reflections about the user’s performance to the task**
    - He performed much better on this task than my expectation. I expected that it would take little longer than the amount of time he spent on this task, but since he could find the information he needed to find more quickly, I think the content organization and the design of the current FaQ page is good enough.
- **Re-design choices**
    - I do not think we need to change something in the FaQ page since the interviewee could successfully find the information he needed to find.
- **Additional Notes**
    - Since he could successfully finish the second task, even more quickly than my expectation, I do not think we need to change something in the FaQ tab.

Task 3: You have an idea for a club-wide event and want to get in contact with the bowling club's event coordinator. Find the contact information of the events coordinator.

- **Did you evaluate the desktop or mobile design?**
    - desktop

    - As expected, after listening to the task, he went to "Connect" page directly and found the email address of the event coordinator.
- **User’s reaction / feedback to the design** (e.g., specific problems or issues found in the tasks)
    - He told me that he liked the way we organized contacts of members in our "Connect" page, and it was easy to find the contact of the event coordinator.
- **Your reflections about the user’s performance to the task**
    - Since he easily found the contact information that he needed to find in the "Connect" page, I think the content in the "Connect" page is well organized.
- **Re-design choices**
    - I do not think we need to change something from the current "Connect" page since both I and the interviewee felt content about the current "Connect" page.
- **Additional Notes**
    - Because he could easily finish the third task, I think we can leave the "Connect" page as it currently is.

## Changes Based on User Testing (Final Submission)

> What changes did you make to your design based on user testing?

- Change position of buttons for FAQ (on mobile and desktop) to improve usability and make it easier for user to open and close quickly. Some participants pointed out the difficulty of using this particular feature when the button "jumps."
- Change size and color of the FAQ button to make them clear and prominent (make sure that the user doesn't confuse the whole "tab" as the button).
- Added more merchandise information based on user feedback about the accuracy of our content.


## Final Notes to the Graders (Final Submission)

> 1. Give us three specific strengths of your site that sets it apart from the previous website of the client (if applicable) and/or from other websites. Think of this as your chance to argue for the things you did really well.

The client did not have a previous website, but rather a Campus Groups page.

1) Our website helps to put faces to the name of the club by including photos of the club and the leadership.

2) Makes accessing important information more streamlined & provides detailed descriptions of club logistics and expectations.

3) Gives insight into the club's culture and "vibe."

4) Makes it easier to get involved with the club through providing contact information and other important links for new members.


> 2. Tell us what you, as a team, learned while working on this project.

- Setting small goals and deadlines for ourselves is important.
- Using Git in a group setting and managing conflicts.
- Learned how to design for a client and their audience.
- Learned how to collaborate with a client in a more professional sense.

> 3. Tell us anything else you need us to know for when we're looking at the project.

We don't have a page for each group member (we have four pages instead of five)-- we were not provided enough content four five full pages, nor did we believe five pages were necessary to meet our users' goals.
