                <p class="answer">Dues are usually due 2 weeks after Clubfest, which coincides with the start of League.</p>

                <p class="question">What does the club with my fees/dues?</p>
                <p class="answer">Dues cover game and shoe fees for meetings 3 times a week, for a total of 6 hours a week on the lanes. Also with membership you receive $1 games at the alley at any other time. You also receive collegiate discounts on bowling equipment.</p>

                <p class="answer">We let people test drive the club, meaning you can come to a couple meetings before making a financial commitment. After that we will ask that you pay dues.</p>

                <p class="question">Do members get free merch?</p>
                <p class="answer">
                    No, club merchandise fees are <strong>not</strong> included in dues as this keeps dues low and financially accessible to a larger group of people. If you would like merch, you can purchase it from our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bigredbowling/?hl=en">Instagram</a> or contact Luke Forsman at <a href="mailto:lft25@cornell.edu" class="email">lft25@cornell.edu</a>.

                <p class="question">What kind of events are being planned? How can I find about them?</p>
                <p class="answer">
                    You can find out about specific events from club meeetings, our GroupMe, and emails (once you join the Listserv). Events change each semester, and we are always open for ideas. In the past we’ve done movie nights, karaoke outings, and date nights at Old Mexico.

                <p class="question">How do I join the competitive team?</p>
                <p class="answer">
                    Those who are interested in joining the traveling competitive team should see the Competitive Team page for more information about when tryouts begin. The team roster must be set early in the semester due to administrative reasons, so reach out sooner rather than later.

                <p class="question">Can I be in the Bowling Club and on the Competitive team at the same time? Can I just be in the Club? Can I just be on the Competitive team?</p>
                <p class="answer">
                    Yes, Yes, and No probably not. The Bowling Club is open to all skill levels of bowlers, which includes competitive ones interested in traveling. But the competitive team is a small fraction of the club that consists of our best and most avid bowlers. The majority of our members do not bowl competitively, as it is a large time and sometimes financial commitment. <em>You can’t be part of the competitive team but not part of the club, since the competitive team is a sub-group of theclub.</em>

                <p class="question">What happens if I no longer want to be a part of the competitive team?</p>
                <p class="answer">You would notify the Captain and the rest of the competitive team as this would change rosters and plans for tournaments.</p>
